# Ngx-Emoji-Picker
This project was forked from the [ionic3-emoji-picker](https://github.com/danielehrhardt/ionic3-emoji-picker) project created by [danielehrhardt](https://github.com/danielehrhardt)

## What's New
 - Fixed the [AOT (Ahead Of Time) Compile error](https://github.com/danielehrhardt/ionic3-emoji-picker/issues/8) or simply put the **---prod** build compile error.
 - Upgraded the library from a **Ng2** project to a **Ng7** project.
 - Upgraded the library **RxJs** from **v5**  to **v6** to make it support new angular versions.
 - Now compatible with **Ng2** - **Ng7** projects and as well as **Ionic 3/4**.
